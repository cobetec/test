In order to have an image gallery as a home page you need to create a new page. Go to Pages > Add a page > select Gallery page, add a title and click on Add page. Then select the new page you have created and tick the option 'Convert into the home page'. 

You can link each of the images of the gallery to the different sections of your site to create a visual menu.
